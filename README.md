All Social is a UWP app for Windows 10 Mobile to allow the user to access their social media accounts from one app.

Small memory footprint, open source, and forever free. Not recomended for heavy users of the social media accounts within this app.
***
This app has the Facebook and Instagram TOP BAR locked permanently, and I've removed ads.
If anyone wants the ads added back in, I'll look into it.
***
This app is **NOT** associated in **ANY** way with Facebook, Inc/Instagram, Inc/Twitter, Inc.
***
__All Social Privacy__

No personal, or private, information of either you, or your device, is collected by this app.

Neither is ANY information transmitted by this app.
